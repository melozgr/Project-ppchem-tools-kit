# Tools Kit

The **tools kit** package allows chemistry students to find basic information on molecules as well as providing an easy access to graphs and calculations required in the experimental laboratories carried out.


## How to use the Tools Kit package

### 1. Forking the repository
To begin, fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
In order to do so, the student must navigate to the repository page and press the *"Fork"* button. The repository will then be copied to your account and you will be able to access it.

### 2. Cloning of the repository

With the code `git clone https://github.com/*username*/Project-ppchem-tools-kit.git` and replacing *username* by your username, a local copy is created.

### 3. Using the Tools Kit

- replace line 24 with path to your folder 
- run code 

**i.** *Molecule Name*

Upon entering the molecule's raw formula, the Tools Kit will output the SMILEs of that molecule.

**ii** *SMILEs*

Input of the molecule's SMILEs gives the corresponding molar mass, in g/mol.

**iii.** *Excel Graph*

By inputting an excel document with only x and y values arranged in two columns, the Tools Kit will print out the corresponding graph, plotting all the values.

**iv.** *Linear Regression* 

By inputting an excel document, the Tools Kit will output the linear regression regression graph, as well as the R<sup>2</sup> value.

The graphs in part iii. and iv. can also take input Title, and X, Y axis labels.
